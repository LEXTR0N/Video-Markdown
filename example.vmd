The YAML header (or front matter) above defines metadata for the entire video:

# Scene: Welcome to Video Markdown

/* 
Scenes are the top-level containers in VMD.
Each scene must contain exactly ONE primary content element:
- Slide OR
- Video OR
- Screencast
*/

## Slide (title="Welcome to Video Markdown", lang="EN")
/* 
A slide element displays static content.
Attributes:
- title: Title displayed at the top of the slide
- lang: Language code (used for multilingual content)

Note: If you use lang attributes in one slide/teleprompt,
you must use them consistently throughout the entire project!
*/

- Video Markdown makes creating educational videos easy
- Use a simple text-based format to define your content
- Add interactive elements like buttons and quizzes
- Support for multiple languages

/* 
Bullet points are created with the "-" symbol.
They'll appear as a list in your rendered slide.
*/

## Teleprompt (title="Welcome", lang="EN")
/* 
Teleprompts contain the narration script that should be read during the scene.
This text doesn't appear on the slide but is used by the presenter.
*/

Welcome to this introduction to Video Markdown! In this short tutorial, I'll show you 
how this simple text-based format can make creating educational videos much easier. 
Video Markdown, or VMD, allows you to define your content, add interactive elements,
and even support multiple languages - all in a single text file.


# Scene: Key Components

## Slide (title="Key Components of VMD", lang="EN")
### Column (width=50)
/* 
The Column element creates a layout Column.
The width attribute specifies the percentage width.
*/

- **Scenes**: Top-level containers
- **Slides**: Visual content with text and images
- **Teleprompts**: Narration scripts

### Column (width=50)
- **Buttons**: Interactive navigation
- **Quizzes**: Knowledge testing
- **Code Snippets**: Technical demonstrations

### Button (name="learnMore", label="Learn More", action="scene: Interactive Elements") 
/* 
A button element creates an interactive button.
Attributes:
- name: Unique identifier for this button
- label: Text displayed on the button
- action: What happens when clicked (here, navigation to another scene)
*/

## Teleprompt (title="Key Components", lang="EN")
Now let's look at the key components of VMD. Scenes are your top-level containers,
grouping related content together. Slides contain the visual content that viewers will see,
while teleprompts hold the narration script. 

VMD also supports interactive elements like buttons for navigation, quizzes to test knowledge,
and code snippets for technical demonstrations. [!show:learnMore] Notice the button that just appeared?
You can click it to navigate to another scene. This demonstrates how VMD supports interactive elements.


# Scene: Interactive Elements

## Slide (title="Interactive Elements", lang="EN")
[!bullet0] - Buttons can trigger navigation or other actions
[!bullet1] - Quizzes help test viewer understanding
[!bullet2] - Code snippets show programming examples

/* 
[!bulletX] markers create bullets that can be shown/hidden with commands.
*/

### Code (snippet="greetingFunction")
/* 
The Code element references a code snippet.
The actual code content will be automatically inserted from external files
or predefined snippets in your project.

The snippet attribute gives it a name that can be referenced elsewhere.
*/

## Teleprompt (title="Interactive Elements", lang="EN")
Let's explore some of the interactive elements available in VMD. [!show:bullet0] First, 
we have buttons, which can trigger navigation between scenes or other actions.

[!show:bullet1] Next, we have quizzes, which are great for testing viewer understanding 
and making your videos more engaging.

[!show:bullet2] And finally, we have code snippets, which are perfect for demonstrating 
programming concepts. Let me show you an example:

In line [!line:greetingFunction-start], we define a simple JavaScript function that greets a user.
And in line [!line:greetingFunction-return], we return the greeting. This is a simple example,
but you can include code in any programming language.


# Scene: Knowledge Check

## Slide (title="Knowledge Check", lang="EN")
- Let's test your knowledge about VMD
- Answer the following questions

## Quiz (name="basicQuiz", title="Test Your VMD Knowledge")
/* 
The Quiz element creates an interactive quiz.
Questions are defined with ### and options with + (correct) or - (incorrect).
*/

### What is the first element in a VMD file?
- Comments
+ YAML header
- Scene
- Slide

### Which symbol is used for correct quiz answers?
- Minus (-)
+ Plus (+)
- Asterisk (?)
- Equal (=)

## Teleprompt (title="Knowledge Check", lang="EN")
Now, let's test your understanding with a quick quiz. [!quiz:basicQuiz] I'll give you a 
moment to answer these questions about VMD.


# Scene: Multi-language Support

/* 
Important: If you start using multiple languages in your project,
you must maintain all content in all languages consistently throughout
the entire project. All slides and teleprompts must have language attributes.
*/

## Slide (title="Multiple Languages Support", lang="EN")
- Create content in multiple languages
- Just specify the language code in elements
- Perfect for international audiences

## Teleprompt (title="Multi-language Support", lang="EN")
VMD makes it easy to create content in multiple languages. By simply specifying the language
code in your elements, you can maintain different versions of your content in the same file.
This is perfect for reaching international audiences.


# Scene: German Version

## Slide (title="Unterstützung für mehrere Sprachen", lang="DE")
- Erstellen Sie Inhalte in mehreren Sprachen
- Geben Sie einfach den Sprachcode in den Elementen an
- Perfekt für internationales Publikum

## Teleprompt (title="Mehrsprachige Unterstützung", lang="DE")
VMD macht es einfach, Inhalte in mehreren Sprachen zu erstellen. Indem Sie einfach den
Sprachcode in Ihren Elementen angeben, können Sie verschiedene Versionen Ihres Inhalts
in derselben Datei pflegen. Dies ist perfekt, um internationale Zielgruppen zu erreichen.


# Scene: Media Integration

## Slide (title="Media Integration", lang="EN")
- Include images, videos, and screencasts
- Reference external media files
- Perfect for demonstrations

### Image (source="example_image.png")
/* 
The Image element displays an image.
The source attribute points to an image file.
*/

## Teleprompt (title="Media Integration", lang="EN")
VMD also makes it easy to integrate various media types. You can include images
for visual references. In separate scenes, you can also add videos for pre-recorded 
content, and screencasts for software demonstrations. Remember that each scene can only
have one primary content type (Slide, Video, or Screencast).


# Scene: Video Example

## Video (source="example_video.mp4")
/* 
The Video element includes a video file.
The source attribute points to a video file.
Note: A scene can only contain ONE primary content element,
so this scene has Video instead of Slide.
*/

## Teleprompt (title="Video Example", lang="EN")
This is an example of a scene with a Video element. Notice that there's no Slide
element in this scene - each scene must contain exactly one primary content type.


# Scene: Screencast Example

## Screencast (source="example_screencast.mp4")
/* 
The Screencast element is used for software demonstrations.
Like Video, it's a primary content element, so a scene with a Screencast
cannot also have a Slide or Video element.
*/

## Teleprompt (title="Screencast Example", lang="EN")
This is an example of a scene with a Screencast element, which is perfect for
software demonstrations. Again, note that there's no Slide element in this scene.


# Scene: Conclusion

## Slide (title="Start Using VMD Today!", lang="EN")
- Simple, text-based format
- Rich interactive features
- Multi-language support
- Perfect for educational content

### Button (name="startButton", label="Get Started", action="https://github.com/your-repo/vmd") 
/* 
Buttons can also link to external URLs.
*/

## Teleprompt (title="Conclusion", lang="EN")
In conclusion, Video Markdown provides a powerful yet simple way to create educational
videos. With its text-based format, rich interactive features, and multi-language support,
it's perfect for educators, trainers, and content creators. [!show:startButton] Ready to
